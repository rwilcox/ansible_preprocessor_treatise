Here I play with [M4](https://www.gnu.org/software/m4/manual/m4.html) to provide the following abilities on top of Ansible:

  1. Static varible definitions
  2. a one-file-per-task task library, seperate from the concept of playbooks
  3. An "if file X override exists use that, else use the default" functionality.

This may or may not be an actual good idea in production, but I do give some use cases where it _might_ be useful. (Or maybe it's horrid in practice. IDK! It was fun Science!)
